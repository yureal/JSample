# JSample
WAV File Audio Resampler that doesn't take original sample rate into account

JSample is a piece of software that resamples WAV files.  What makes it unique is the fact that it does not take into account the original sample rate.  This is useful when WAV files are corrupted or recorded with sample rate mis-match that might now allow you to resample to the proper sample rate with other conversion s/w.

********USE AT YOUR OWN RISK********
When converting WAV files using this software, please make a backup of your files first.

JSample makes converting lots of files easy by allowing the user to convert everything in a specified folder.  Simply move all the files you want converted (even if it's hundreds of files) and then run the program and follow the prompts on the screen.

To use just extract the files and run the "JSample.exe"

Enjoy!
